### TO-DO

- [x] Set philosopher struct <br>
- [x] getForks <br>
- [x] putForks <br>
- [x] Set global food variable, don't need this to run forever <br>
- [x] Map results to ensure even distribution of food <br>

Project is working as intended. I also set it up so that the number philosophers can more easily be changed. You can also adjust the amount of food relatively easily. Fun to work on in Python, so much easier in Go. <br>

I guess they really do have this whole concurrency thing figured out.
